# Installing FoliageTool in your Unity project

## Install via Git

Clone the repository into your Unity project's `Packages` folder.
```bash
cd Packages/
git clone https://github.com/GeekBrony/FoliageTool.git
mv FoliageTool/ team.poni.foliage-tool/
```
The commands above clone the repository into a folder with the name of the package.

Once this process is done, Unity should recognize it as a valid package, and you should be ready to [dive in](GettingStarted.md)!
